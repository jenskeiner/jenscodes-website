This is the source of the website [https://docs.jenscodes.sh](https://docs.jenscodes.sh) that hosts the documentation for my open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/jenskeiner).

The first verison of this website was based on the code for the official [Poetry Website](https://python-poetry.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/python-poetry/website). I have since adjusted and changed a lot of the code, but the core structure is still comparable.

Most of the TypeScript code to drive the client-side search functionality was adapted from the [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) project.
